# qvo-go-client
Unofficial Go client for the QVO payment service API (https://www.qvo.cl/).

It's a work in progress which at the moment only supports webpay payment requests, and typical CRUD operations for cutomers, transactions and plans. 
Others will be added some time in the future (right now it does everything I need to support my use case, so I'll get to it whnever I get the time).
